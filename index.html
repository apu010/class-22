                    <h1>Hello, visitor!</h1>
                    <p>Whether you found me on YouTube, Instagram, or just by googling “best fashion blogger ever”, I’m glad you’re here! <span class="bold">Here you will learn quite a lot of things about fashion as well as my fabulous life,</span> including but not limited to my top picks in beauty and styling. Have a look around and be excited!<br><br>

                    My blog is well known for makeup tips and tricks, in writing here since 2011. I originally made those lists for my clients as a reference, but after sending couple of those over to Pinterest I learned that they were actually benefiting to more people than I could ever imagined. Over 100 blog entries later, the Style Park Blog has become primarily fashion and beauty blog.<br><br>
                    
                    I owned an independent private beauty salon before, working behind the reception, for 8 years. I locked the doors and handed over the key just before my darling <span>Oscar</span> was born. Now I stay home with the boys and have the pleasure of dropping some fashion wisdom from time to time here in my blog.</p>

                   <p> Although the blog entries may be centered around appearance and all things related, I don’t believe that is where           self-worth comes from. I’m a devoted Christian and am so thankful to have a connection with the Lord. We attend a great church in our boro.<br><br>

                    Originally from Bismarck, North Dakota, I got tired of being cold and migrated down south. I’ve <span class="italic">lived in South Carolina for 7 years and call sweet, “solid south” city of Columbia our new home.</span><br><br>

                    I just love a piece of chocolate cake and also adore red lipstick. Oh and I always have bobby pins and hairspray in my purse. You know, in case of emergencies.<br><br>

                    It is an honor to share my work with you guys, and also working with brands like Home Goods, Refinery 29, Stokke, and 4moms.
